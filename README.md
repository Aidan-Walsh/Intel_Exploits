# Intel_Exploits
A wide range of different exploits that use different techniques on intel architecture. These techniques include the following: string formatting, sigreturn oriented programming, and stack pivots. 

# Exploiting
These exploits are all written in python using the pwn library - a very helpful library. The goal of these exploits was to pop shells, or run code that lets me run a shell and hopefully, in the end, gain admin privileges. None of these executables were created by me, I just looked for vulnerable executables written by others. You can attempt to run these executables on your machine and see how they work with the following: 
1. Download the executable and its corresponding python exploit. 
2. Run the python file "file.py" (it will run the executable)
    - "python3 file.py"
    - you should now be in a shell! So you can type any commands like "whoami" 
    - it may take a second or two (or longer) to pop the shell depending on the complexity of the exploit
    - if your screen totally changes then you may be in gdb (which is supposed to happen for the exploit to work), if this happens, type "exit" then ENTER

The following explanations are very surface level. To see how they exactly work, check out the python files. \

# b0verflow
This executable is exploited by "flow.py". This exploit utilizes a stack pivot and return oriented programming (ROP). So, the program receives input, has an overflow issue and so we overwrite the return address to an instruction in memory that subtracts the stack pointer. This lets us execute an instruction that lets us execute instructions on the stack, that we have planted with our input. Thus, we are able to run our instructions on the stack that tell the program to pop a shell. 

#mary_morton
This executable is exploited by "mary.py". This attack uses string formatting,
